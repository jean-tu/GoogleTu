# GoogleTu
Created a simple search engine that implemented the PageRank Algorithm that is what Google was first known for. This program utilized: 
* C++ 
* PageRank Algorithm 
* Qt
* Merge Sort 
* Templates

##Why 
This was an assignment for one of my CS classes and I had thought that it was definetly one of the ones that was more challenging. This assignment required us to utilize the PageRank Algorithm and other algorithms such as merge sort. 

##Name? 
The reason why I named this assignment GoogleTu is because we had to use the ranking algorithm that made Google known, I decided to create a "second" version I guess you can say. My last name is said like the number "Two" so I was trying to be creative by naming it Google Two. I had used Adobe Photoshop to add on the additional tu letters.
